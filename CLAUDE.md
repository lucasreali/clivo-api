## Cortex — decision memory

This project records its technical decisions with cortex (MCP server
`cortex`, tools: `save_decision`, `save_session_summary`,
`get_context`, `get_impact`, `search`, `search_all_projects`).

- Before proposing an approach or changing existing behavior, call
  `get_context` with your intent (or `search` with keywords) — a past
  decision may already govern this code.
- Before reworking code a decision anchors, call `get_impact` with the
  decision id to see everything the change touches.
- When the user confirms a non-obvious decision, save it with
  `save_decision`.
- When the session ends (or a milestone lands), persist an
  "Implemented / Decisions / Open" narrative with `save_session_summary`
  — the "Open" section is how the next session recovers unfinished work.
- Decision files live in `.cortex/decisions/` and are committed with the
  code they explain.
- If semantic search returns nothing useful, embeddings may be missing —
  suggest running `cortex embed --missing`.
